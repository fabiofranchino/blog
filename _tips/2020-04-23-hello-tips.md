New post type in this blog! **Tips!**

This blog used to contain two main post type, the Blog post, articles mostly related on what I've learned by direct experience, and the Log post, a quick comment about something I've found around.

Today I'd like to introduce a new one, Tip post, a quick explanation about technical bits I learn along the way. It's something much more close to a snippet unit instead of a tutorial.

Before that, those kind of tips were placed in Logs, I thought they would have deserved a better place.

## The tools

During the course we're using [Codepen.io](https://codepen.io/) as editor. It's totally straightforwar since it requires an account, which is free, to start with. The browser of choice is [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), therefore, download it whether you don't have it already.

While Codepen is very handy and quick to setup, there are some limitation we need to overcome in some way. In order to show an image/video within a Pen, we need to put those assets online somewhere. Images cannot be uploaded with the free account of Codepen, therefore, an alternative is to use a third-party service, unless you already have a server at your fingertips.

My suggestion is to use Github, which offers a free account with unlimited public repositories. Github provides also a nice drag&drop feature to upload files using only the web interface. This make it a perfect candidate to store and serve assets that can be used by our Codepen sketches. Here you can follow a little tutorial about how to setup a Github repository that suit for our purpose.

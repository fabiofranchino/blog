It's not a secret that I'm building and running a [presentation software](https://www.presenta.cc/).

In this page I want to keep track of other presentation software with a particular focus on novel and innovative solutions. I've already mentioned [some of them](/blog/lets-talk-about-presentation-tools/) on my blog, this page would be an up-to-date reference on the topic.

## The status quo

The usual and well known tools that everybody are used to when dealing with presentation documents. This is what I call "the status quo" here since 30 years and (apparently) the only way to build and manage presentation documents:

- Microsoft PowerPoint
- Apple Keynote
- Google Presentations

## The new breed

Luckly enough, there's always the will to innovate and the following list proves that. A collection of tools that try to think differently in order to innovate in the presentation field:

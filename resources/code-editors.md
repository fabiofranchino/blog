I write code daily and I teach people (mostly designers) how to write code for creative purposes often.

To write code, you need a code editor.

I currently write code on serious projects using Visual Studio Code but I costantly test and use alternatives, usually online tools, both for quick sketches and for teaching activity. 

Here my preferred list of editors divided in online and offline tools. 

### Online Editors

I currently use online editor both for quick explorations and for teaching purposes. During a class, the zero-setup is invaluable. Here a from time to time updated list of my preferred tools out there:

- [P5 WebEditor](https://editor.p5js.org/) perfect when teaching creative coding with p5.js
- [Codepen](https://codepen.io/) for quick exploration in HTML/CSS/JS
- [Repl.it](https://repl.it/) is a good option for more structured projects with deploy capability
- [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) very good for quick app (both frontend and backend) similar to Repl.it
- [Runkit](https://runkit.com/) for node-based sketches, now I'm much more on Observable for such explorations
- [Observable](https://beta.observablehq.com) I recently started using it for quick explorations and it's great
- [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) looks interesting but I didn't use it yet
- [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/) looks interesting but I didn't use it yet
- [JsBin](http://jsbin.com/?html,js,output) I used to write quick sketches in HTML/CSS/JS, then replaced with Codepen

### Standalone Editors

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (currently my preferred choice for serious projects)
- [Brackets](http://brackets.io/) (I used for teaching purposes, not used anymore)
- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) (it was my editor of choice, not used anymore)

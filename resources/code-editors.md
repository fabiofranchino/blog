If you, like me, write code for your creative and productive purposes, here an updated list of the possibility...

I'm currently prefer relying to online tools as much as I can, expecially for teaching purposes because they ease a lot the set up phase.

Here my preferred list of editors divided in online and offline tools. 

### Online Editors

[Codepen.io](https://codepen.io/) is one option I use when teaching. It's free and hides some complexity helping primer students. There are some drawback such as the possibility to host external files (usually images and text files, even though the premium account can do that). To solve this issue, refer to this section where I've outlined some  third-party services

- [P5 WebEditor](https://editor.p5js.org/)
- [Codepen](https://codepen.io/)
- [Repl.it](https://repl.it/)
- [JsBin](http://jsbin.com/?html,js,output)
- [Glitch](https://glitch.com/)
- [Observable](https://beta.observablehq.com)
- [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/)

### Standalone Editors

- Visual Studio Code
- Brackets

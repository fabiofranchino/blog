It's all about the web platform. An awesome platform that drive the whole internet.

Speaking of which, the first thing we do need is a browser.  
Chrome has been always my browser of choice because the point has always been learning D3 and dataviz techniques, not how to deal with the browser inconsintency.  
Furthermore, Chrome provides the best developer tool out there.

The second tool we need is a code editor. We are going to write some code, thus, we need a tool that allows us to write code.

There are some options out there. I've usually prefer two, depending of the situation:

- [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) or [JsBin](http://jsbin.com/)
- [Brackets](http://brackets.io/)

The first option requires only the browser since they are online code editor. Just go there and start coding. It's very quick for short sessions since it doesn't require installation.

The second option require to download and install a desktop software, then familiarize a bit with it. In more structured course it's the best option because it allows to work with the local filesystem. Furthermore it includes a local web server which is essential when it needs to load local external files.

The web platform is an incredible environment.  
One of its fortune is the ability to accomodate different technologies in the same box with some wires to let them talk and cooperate.

We've learned what is [HTML](understanding-html), an essential descriptive language to create and structure content. Now it's time to meet another technology built-in in the browser, which is the CSS (Cascading Style Sheet).

The CSS is responsible to style visual properties. It's not the content but how it looks like.

The main concept of CSS is the selection mechanism. Given a HTML document, you can select one or more HTML tags using `rules`. Let's say, given this HTML document:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head></head>
  
  <body>
    <h1>This is a Title</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

We want to color the text in red, we need to add the following code to the document:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <style>
      h1{
          color:red;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  
  <body>
    <h1>This is a Title</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

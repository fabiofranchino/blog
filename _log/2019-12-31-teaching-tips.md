I want to remind myself a tip for a very common issue when teaching to students.

One of the most effective way to teach something to students is by leveraging the engagement in class, but:

> The teaching strategy of asking a question and waiting for the brave souls who are not intimidated by speaking up in front of the class is the least effective in terms of generating group involvement.

and here a possible solution:

> The more you use students names in class, the more you break down the silence barrier and encourage participation.

Not enough, but it may help.

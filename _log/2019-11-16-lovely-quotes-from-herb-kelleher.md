There are a couple of quotes that are great from this [blog](https://maeda.pm/2019/01/12/herb-kelleher-1931-2019/) post.

The post is related to a TIME article about Herb Kelleher, Founder/CEO of Southwest Airlines. I really love these quotes:

> We have a strategic plan. It’s called ‘doing things.’

and this:

> If you create an environment where the people truly participate, you don’t need control. They know what needs to be done and they do it.

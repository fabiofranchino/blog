Finally, the [Leap Motion](https://www.leapmotion.com/technology/) sensor now makes completely sense in VR worlds.

As it is very useless and little iteresting in the real world, it is very powerful in VR space where the user can have virtual hands without additional hardware equipments.

Kudos for their resilience.

Today I've spent a not-so-nice hour of my time trying to solve an unexpected issue after upgrading my MacOsX.

I wasn't able to log-in anymore, thus, I had to investigate a bit in order to solve this `little` problem.

[Here](https://smyl.es/how-to-fix-mac-osx-stuckhanging-on-progress-bar-will-not-boot/) the resource that helps a lot on finding and solving the issue as well.

It's all related to some custom `kext` OS extension that was not compatible anymore the new Operating System.

Removing them I was able to log-in again.

Not, get back to work!

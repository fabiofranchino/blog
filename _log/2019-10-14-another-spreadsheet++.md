I've already written about the new breeds of spreadsheets belonging to the low-code movement [here](/blog/log/the-rise-of-a-new-breed-of-spreadsheets) and /blog/log/fluidtable-the-modern-spreadsheet. 

There's another one, even though I dunno whether it's a new kid in the block or not. 

[Retool](https://retool.com/) looks very promising. It's meant to be a development environment for internal tools. 

There's undoubtfully an increasing need of custom tools for companies because the complexity requires tools to be understood and managed. 

At the same time, making custom tools is costly, therefore, a solution such Retool can find its niche.

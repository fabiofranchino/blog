I've already written about the new breed of spreadsheets belonging to the low-code movement [here](/blog/log/the-rise-of-a-new-breed-of-spreadsheets) and [here](/blog/log/fluidtable-the-modern-spreadsheet). 

There's another one, even though I dunno whether it's a new kid in the block or not. 

[Retool](https://retool.com/) looks very promising. It's meant to be a development environment for internal tools. 

There's undoubtfully an increasing need of custom tools for companies because their complexity requires tools to allow better understanding and management. 

At the same time, making custom tools is costly, therefore, a solution such as Retool can find its niche quite easily.

I can see also some opportunities for IT consultants that might adopt and propose those tools to cut the costs, especially for small/mid businesses.

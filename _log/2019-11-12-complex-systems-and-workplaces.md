I've got interested in complex systems and how they can help understand our lives and social relations.

A workplace is a complex system because a human being is a complex system.

There are some hints learned from some books I've read recently:

- A complex system can't be directly influenced
- But it can be modified indirectly by using catalyzing parameters
- In a workplace, such parameters can be the autonomy, recognition, fee and benefits.

Other interesting factors to be improved in order to improve a complex situation are:

- interconnections between the actors (a better communication)
- redundancy among the actors
- the error friendly possibilities
- network building

Those hints come from the study and the observation of complex systems in nature and they can be applied to human-based complex systems as well.

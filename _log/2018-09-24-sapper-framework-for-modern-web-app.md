If you're excited, like me, about frameworks that foster modern webapp development such as [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), here a new kind on the block: [Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.technology/).

It's based on similar principles of the mentioned competitors but it uses [Svelte](https://svelte.technology/) for  UI development (as the others use Vue.js and React.js).

Maybe one day I'll give it a try, who knows?

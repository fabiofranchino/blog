What does `serverless` mean?

[Here](https://dev.to/paulswail/the-differing-definitions-of-serverless-2h3k) a round up of experts trying to define this buzz-word.

My quick definition is: 

> Serverless means that you don't have to think about server infrastructure complexity.

Here's the deal: you code an app on your local machine and it works great! Then you can deploy it to some `serverless` thing and it will continue to work great at scale.

A solar powered website

What a great project! A website served by a solar-powered only server machine!

[Here](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/) the full details I stringly suggest to read!

And great quote here:

> This website runs on a [solar powered server](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/about.html) located in Barcelona, and will go off-line during longer periods of cloudy weather. This page shows live data relating to power supply, power demand, and energy storage.

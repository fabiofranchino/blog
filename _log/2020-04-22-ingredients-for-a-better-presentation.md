[Nice article](https://www.ideasonstage.com/news/2020/01/29/2020-01-29-the_3_magic_ingredients_of_great_presentations/) from Phil Waknell about making better presentations.

It's all about context + audience (expectations).

There is no one-size-fits-all recipe, no magic formula here.

But, adding something personal makes always the difference between different presentation deliveries.

And the goal of a speech should always be about transforming the audience, making some change to them, having an impact, like a good story can does most of the time.

The UX Engineer

It's sign of the time this role definition from [Google](https://design.google/jobs/ux-engineer/):

> As a UX Engineer, youâ€™ll weave together strong design aesthetics with technical know-how.

Note aside, the addendum in a job description interviewing a similar role is a great way to inform potential interested people to that position, figuring out their future role.

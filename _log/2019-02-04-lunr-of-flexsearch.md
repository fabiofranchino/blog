Lunr of FlexSearch?

Funny enough, I've [just investigate](/blog/how-to-make-a-client-side-search-engine-with-vue-and-lunr/) on a client-side seach js library (Lunr) that a new kid on the block in the same field ([FlexSeach](https://github.com/nextapps-de/flexsearch)) has been shipped recently.

Should I make a POC to test it out? :)

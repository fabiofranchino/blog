I like this sentence from this [article](http://mrmrs.cc/writing/chaos-design/) that represents very well a design perspective of [PRESENTA](https://www.presenta.cc)

> The goal is not to eliminate options, itâ€™s to narrow focus on the essential, allowing for expansion and exploration if necessary.

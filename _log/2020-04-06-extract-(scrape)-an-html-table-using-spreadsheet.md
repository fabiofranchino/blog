Extract (scrape) an HTML table using Spreadsheet

You heard right. [There is a function](https://thenextweb.com/basics/2020/03/31/holy-sheet-heres-how-to-grab-a-web-pages-data-with-google-sheets/) (=IMPORTHTML) that allows to import a fragment of a webpage transforming it in a machine-readable data table.

Preatty neat, isn't it?

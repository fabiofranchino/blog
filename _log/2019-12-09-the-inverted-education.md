The inverted education

What about if a historian teacher, instead of explaining a specific event, would give a study homework of the same event, and the following lesson the students have to role-play the event in order to demonstrate what they studied? Furthermore, the teacher can fix and add further notions in order to complete the picture?

Wouldn't it be more effective than a traditional frontal lecture?

I love a Vin√©m Flusser essay I've read recently about the etymology of the words Design, Art and Technology, suggesting they all belong to a similar root but, for some reasons, now they are confined to very different domains.

Technology and Science on one, cold and logic, side, Art and Design to the other, warm and instinctive one.

We need to remind their origin.

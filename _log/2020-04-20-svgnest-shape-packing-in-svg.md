SVGnest: Shapes packing in SVG

[SVGnest](https://github.com/Jack000/SVGnest) is a library that allows to compute a packed layout using non regular shapes.

It looks very efficient, maybe one day it might come in handy.

## Bin Packing

There's also [this](http://incise.org/2d-bin-packing-with-javascript-and-canvas.html ) library to compute bin packing (rectangles) in an efficient way.

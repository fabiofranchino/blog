New big updates along this week that requires a bit of time to explore:

- [Electron](https://electronjs.org/)  3.0.0 version release is out!
- [Nuxt.js]() 2.0 version

Electron is THE solution if you want to create native-like application using the web technologies while Nuxt is the future of the website development.

Client side search with three js libs

I've already tested **Lunr** in [PRESENTA](https://www.presenta.cc/).

I've then discovered **FlexSearch** as an alternative documented in this quick [post](/blog/log/lunr-of-flexsearch).

Now, [JS Search](https://github.com/bvaughn/js-search) is another option.

Since I'm planning to add client search capability to this blog, I'm thinking to make a POC to taste better the differences.

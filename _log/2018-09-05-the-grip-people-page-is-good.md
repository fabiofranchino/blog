Take a look of [this](https://www.griplimited.com/people). A very good example of people page!

No, it's not because the dogs. It's good because **it does engage the user**, letting him/her **play** and **discover** the funny drawing over each thumbnail. And thanks to this mechanism, the page (and the connected brand) becomes memorable, the ultimate goal of any communication object.

Don't miss the whole [site](https://www.griplimited.com/) which is worth to navigate.

Kudos to them!

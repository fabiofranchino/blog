[Designing with code](https://matthewstrom.com/writing/designing-with-code.html).

This is funny since I've always thought the same but never advertised it because I've felt a bit out of place. 

I do prefer designing with code instead using the usual designer-friendly tools. I think it's a quicker way to discover issues than using the common mockup phase.

I'm happy to see more and more people recognizing it.

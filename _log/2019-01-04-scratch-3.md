Scratch 3.0 is out.

I've already poked with Scratch 2 for a while and this new version looks very interesting.

I've been thinking a bit lately about using Scratch to introduce the coding main principles to my design students before diving into real code.

Let's see whether there'll be a good opportunity to test this idea.

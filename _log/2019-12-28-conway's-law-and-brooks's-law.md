Taking the chance to remember a couple of important laws while reading [this article](https://augustl.com/blog/2019/best_bug_predictor_is_organizational_complexity/) about the first cause of software bugs, according to a Microsoft research, that is the organisation structure that affect the software structure.

The idea is that if the organisation is complex, the resulting software will be complex as well producing more bugs. This is precisely what [Conway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law) stated in his law.

Another law that need to be mentioned is the [Brooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks%27s_law) one related to the number of people that affect the time of the delivery of the project.

This is a tip learned from the book 'On Writing' by Stephen King. 

The communication among the writer and a reader is made through a channel. 

In order to activate such channel (and get the reader attention) a common frequency, a tune, an harmony, is required between the sides. An harmony made by similar thoughts and experiences.

Once the channel is active, everything should follow a promise, the promise to tell the truth.

An effective communication is always made by trust and confidence.

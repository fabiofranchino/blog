Protecting access to services is an hot topic and it's going to be more hot in the near future.

That's why I consider great the [WebAuthn](https://webauthn.guide/) proposal as a standard mechanism to authenticate a client with a server in a secure way.

The idea is simple: the password is not anymore choosen by the user (because more than 80% of access breach is caused by weaked passwords) but by the computer by means of private-public key method.

Simple great and looking forward to see it cross implemented in any modern browsers.

There's a tiny line that connect a real capable **leader** with his **communication** skills. There's no doubt that a true leader is very good at communicating with other people.

I mean real communication, with capital letter, the effective communication made through trust and confidence among the sender and his receiver.

**Trust** is the keyword. If you are able to instill trust when you communicate, you are basically a great communicator, and for extension, a leader.

Being a great communicator means you can inspire (persuade) people.

And btw, being a great communicator you can sell anything you want.

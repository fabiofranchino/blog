Reading "The Inevitable" from Kevin Kelly, here a very interesting citation and passage:

> In an information-rich world, the wealth of information means a dearth of something else: a scarcity of whatever it is that information consumes. 
>
> What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention.

From Herbert Simon, a Nobel Prize-winning in 1971!

> In a world of abundance, the only scarcity is human attention.

That means that our attention is precious and it's a resource other players want, meaning this is where moneys follow.

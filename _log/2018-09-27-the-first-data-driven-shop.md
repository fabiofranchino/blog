The first data-driven shop.

Amazon, obviously.

[Today](https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/26/17907520/amazon-4-star-retail-store-new-york-soho) [launched](https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/26/amazon-will-open-a-new-brick-and-mortar-store-in-nyc-featuring-its-best-sellers/?guccounter=1) its first physical shop (Amazon 4-star, in New York) based on the data they are able to analyze.

Stars, reviews, whish lists, trends, best selling, you name it.

It's the first time a shop's catalog and layout has been shaped by data-insights.

This is just the beginning.

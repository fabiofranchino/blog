The User Experience is a complex problem, therefore, in order to solve it, it requires a diverse team made by different skills able to pursue a common goal.

I like this [article](http://boagworld.com/dev/why-you-should-want-to-be-a-user-experience-developer/) and its thesis about the formal lack of the User Experience Developer role in many teams.

The technical aspects can affect the UX in so many ways and so drastically. A developer working for a digital product needs to think also in UX terms and a digital product team cannot exclude the developers in any UX design activity.

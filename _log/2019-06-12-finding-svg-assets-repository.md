Finding SVG assets repository

Since I've built SVGmator, I got interested in finding good resources to get interesting SVG assets.

Here the current list, I'll make updated eventually:

- https://elements.envato.com/graphics
- https://lovesvg.com/
- https://www.vecteezy.com/
- [https://isoflat.com](https://isoflat.com/)

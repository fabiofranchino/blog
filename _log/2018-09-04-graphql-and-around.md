I've heard about it many times but haven't tried it out yet. [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/), the query language for the API invented by Facebook, looks interesting and, most probably, is going to be the near future in terms of service development.

[Here](https://github.com/marmelab/json-graphql-server) a good and quick way to get started in 30 secs: a json-backed GraphQL server ready to be used after an `npm i json-graphql-server`.

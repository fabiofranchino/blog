There are already signals of a nascent ecosystem around [Notion](https://www.notion.so/).

Here an [article](https://css-tricks.com/notion-powered-websites/) that outlines how to use Notion as **CMS** for static website. Here some starting points for those who want to experiment with it:

- [Fruition](https://fruitionsite.com/)
- [Super](https://super.so/)
- [HostNotion](https://hostnotion.co/)
- [HostingPotion](https://www.hostingpotion.com/)

It's not an official solution and Notion **might break** it in the near future. For that reason, I'm baffled by the fact some of those services offer even paid tier for something they cannot promise in the long run.

We'll see.

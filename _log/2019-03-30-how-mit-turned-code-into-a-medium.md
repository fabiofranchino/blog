How MIT turned code into a medium

[A beautiful retrospective](https://eyeondesign.aiga.org/how-an-mit-research-group-turned-computer-code-into-a-modern-design-medium/) about the begin of the Aestethic + Computation group at MIT and the born of Processing. A story told by the real partecipants with some little curiosities and behind the scene.

Great read!

It has been always like this and it will be the same, for any Photoshop user.

That made me think about the UI and possible improvements of the user experience in that particular field. What about:

- reducing the blending list providing only the most relevant (maybe allowing the user to manipulate that list)?
- providing a blending pre-viewer (a quick thumbnails grid with all the result in one dash the user can pick from)?

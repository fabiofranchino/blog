Speaking of Company Culture, fostering the growth opportunity is one of the most important pillar in any workplace.

In this very interesting report from [Interactive Things](https://10.interactivethings.com/), there are some good strategies to deal with professional growth.

Here the annotated list of those activities:

- Library rule to allow a calm and focussed enviroment even if in a open space
- Team forum (every 4/6 months) to discuss together about internal issues openly
- Weekly show time to engage the whole team about disseminating interesting bits of information
- Adventure time (bi-monthly) to experience together outside the work routine  and office
- Team assembly, yearly, to review and discuss the company direction and vision
- Hack days, a focussed workshop to build something in a very short time together

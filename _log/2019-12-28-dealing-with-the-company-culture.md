I've got interested in the Company Culture thing lately since I manage a small team of desegners and developers.

I've started to read here and there and I want to be more educated about modern strategies from experts in the field.

As a starting point, I'm going to annotate here an initial list of important components that need to be handled when dealing with the Company Culture concept.

- Compensation
- Learning
- Professional growth
- Work/life balance
- Health enviroment

Happyness is the general outcome of the combination of the above components. When there's a positive culture in a company is because people are happy to be there, so happy that they speak positively about the company even when they don't have to.

FastChart to build charts in seconds

From FinancialTimes, [FastChart](https://fastcharts.io) is a tool to create simple static charts in seconds just pasting the csv data and tweak some controls. This is how I envision the chart part in [PRESENTA](https://www.presenta.cc), though.

Need to think how to evolve that part.

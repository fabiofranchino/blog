The Jekyll fatigue.

Having a blog generated by Jekyll makes everytime I need to add some change an incredibly fatigue even for the very simple task I'd do in seconds in javascript.

I've spent a good whole hour to do a simple array print in my Jekyll and Liquid template.

The solution is obviously simple like that:

```html
{% raw  %}
{{ page.tags | join: ", " }}
{% endraw %}
```

This to remember that even a simple task for someone can be dauting for someone else.

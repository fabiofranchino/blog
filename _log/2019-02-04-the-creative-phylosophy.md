I really love how cristal clear are [his](http://brandongregorycreative.com/design.html) principles in design field.

Every client has a problem to solve. In order to do the job right, here the main principle to follow:

- Define the goal out of a very clear problem
- Define the strategy to reach that goal and the way it'll be measured.
- Now the real work, measure and check the numbers, adapt and continue until reach the goal.

JQ to query JSON files

Today I learned [JQ](https://github.com/stedolan/jq), an handy command line to query JSON files with ease.

There's also a Mac GUI, [jqTerm](https://gumroad.com/l/jqterm), for those who don't want to interact with the CLI (really? querying with CLI command in a quasi-CLI Mac GUI app? mmmh) anyway!

Looks interesting and useful.

Why something get viral on internet? If I try to encode some pattern on items that got viral, I can see three common features: 

- Accessibility
- Emotionality
- Banality

People tend to participate on things that are accessible. This means that specific or very vertical topics get less viral because of that.

Emotion is another important feature. People are willing to participate more when something is not entirely rational. The more it contains some degree of emotional component, the more viral possibility.

The combination of the above two produces the banality component. Usually trivial things are easier to get viral, in general.

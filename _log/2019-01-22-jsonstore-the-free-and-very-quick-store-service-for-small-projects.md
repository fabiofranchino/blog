Today I've discovered another little gem that can help my teaching activity.

[JsonStore](https://www.jsonstore.io/) is an online, open source, service to set up a little cloud-based datastore in zero seconds. You can begin then sending requests to save and retrieve piece of data from the cloud.

This is perfect in some situation to allow my students saving little information from within their little front end explorations in order to give them persistence capability.

Full source code included and the service is totally free! Kudos to [Buzi](https://github.com/bluzi).

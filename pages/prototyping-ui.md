A **prototype** is *"an early sample, model, or release of a product built to test a concept or process or to act as a thing to be replicated or learned from."*

In design context, a prototype is everything since the inception to the final and released product. That means sketches, wireframes, visual comps, demos and all the early releases might be considered a prototyped version in order to improve something for the next cycle.

Prototypes are built with the explicit purpose of learning. Understanding is the product of a prototype. A prototype is meant to validate one or more assumptions. The design practice must be seen as a continuous state of prototyping. It's a way to put the team in an openness to learn position in order to be able to respond accordingly. Test over guess should be a mantra. What's important is not the first try but the second one: how the prototype has been improved based on the previous test.



This page is meant to be a living reference on the present and past technique related to user interface and micro interaction prototiping tools.

Before to dive into the tools pletora we need to distinguis the type of prototypes we're able to build based on needs and technical feasibility.

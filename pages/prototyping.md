A **prototype** is *"an early sample, model, or release of a product built to test a concept or process or to act as a thing to be replicated or learned from."*

In design context, a prototype is everything since the inception to the final and released product. That means sketches, wireframes, visual comps, demos and all the early releases might be considered a prototyped version in order to improve something for the next cycle.

Prototypes are built with the explicit purpose of learning. Understanding is the product of a prototype. A prototype is meant to validate one or more assumptions. The design practice must be seen as a continuous state of prototyping. It's a way to put the team in an openness to learn position in order to be able to respond accordingly. Test over guess should be a mantra. What's important is not the first try but the second one: how the prototype has been improved based on the previous test.

# Digital

This page is meant to be a living reference on the present and past technique related to user interface and micro interaction prototiping tools.

Before to dive into the tools pletora we need to distinguis the type of prototypes we're able to build based on needs and technical feasibility.

## Static comps

- Adobe Photoshop
- Adobe Illustrator
- Sketch

## Animated comps

- Adobe After Effects

## Timeline based comps

- Adobe Edge Animate
- Google Web Designer
- Tumult Hype

## Interactive comps

- Quartz Composer

## High-fidelity compos

- Framer





# Physical

Hardware prototyping has been always an important aspect for any interaction designers and the microcontroller is the center of this discipline. Arduino has the merit to open this world to the masses. Many followed it and new products came out over the last few years. Some looks like Arduino, some others are different.



Processing is like Arduino

## Popular microcontrollers

### Arduino

### Raspberry Pi

### Particle

### Espruino

### Tessel



## Limited, but handful boards to getting started 

### Micro:bit

Micro:bit is a tiny microcontroller produced and sponsored by BBC. Beside the processor it comes with additional modules on-board like two programmable buttons, a 5x5 led matrix, an accelerometer and a compass, 4 analog pins, an micro-USB and Bluetooth module to communicate with the computer.

It's intended to be an very entry level board specifically for newbie and children. It comes with a simplified (borrowing the Scratch UI) online IDE.

From my point of view, it's an interesting hardware to play with software with basic inputs. It can communicate through serial protocol by means of the USB cable connection.

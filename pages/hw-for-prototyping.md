title: HW for prototyping
---

Hardware prototyping has been always an important aspect for any interaction designers and the microcontroller is the center of this discipline. Arduino has the merit to open this world to the masses. Many followed it and new products came out over the last few years. Some looks like Arduino, some others are different.



Processing is like Arduino

## Microcontrollers

### Arduino

### Particle

### Tessel

### Raspberry Pi



## Limited, but very handful, boards 

### Micro:bit

Micro:bit is a tiny microcontroller produced and sponsored by BBC. Beside the processor it comes with additional modules on-board like two programmable buttons, a 5x5 led matrix, an accelerometer and a compass, 4 analog pins, an micro-USB and Bluetooth module to communicate with the computer.

It's intended to be an very entry level board specifically for newbie and children. It comes with a simplified (borrowing the Scratch UI) online IDE.

From my point of view, it's an interesting hardware to play with software with basic inputs. It can communicate through serial protocol by means of the USB cable connection.

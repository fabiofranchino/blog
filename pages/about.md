I was born forty-and-something years ago. I'm italian and I currently live in my country. I'm a father of a way-more-smarter-then-me **girl**.

I have more than fifteen years of **computational design** experience and extensive IT knowledge. I'm actually serving as **CTO** at [TODO](https://todo.to.it/), the design consultancy I've co-founded back in 2007. I'm used to leading the design and development team from a vantage point at the crossroads of design and coding. I love playing with technologies and passionate about Agile principles.

My approach stems from a deep-rooted interest in creative disciplines, ranging from music to design, from performing to generative arts. In 2008 I conceived CSTEM, the first event devoted to computational design practices in art and design in Italy. I'm also a keen educator always been involved in teaching and lecturing at several institutions and workshops. I currently hold teaching positions at SUPSI, Lugano (interaction design at [MAIND Master Program](https://www.maind.supsi.ch/)), [Big Dive](http://www.bigdive.eu/) training program, Turin (data visualization), and [European Institute of Design](http://www.ied.it/), Turin (interface design and prototyping).

I post updates on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/fabiofranchino), committing chunks of code on [Github](https://github.com/abusedmedia) and sometimes update professional info on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abusedmedia/).

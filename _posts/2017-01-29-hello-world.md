First off, a confession.  
I've been always an internet lurker with some [timid](https://therumorsofdata.tumblr.com/) public contributions.   

Most of what I've learned over my career is thanks to the web, a place where, among other things, people use their personal time to organize and share pieces of knowledge, often for free.

I've always felt a bit guilty. That particular feeling in the gut when you owe something to someone.

To mitigate that feeling I did some attempts in the past, in the spirit of giving back, but nothing worth to mention.

I've always told myself a lot of shit in order to keep the things as is.
The most common? That it's too late to begin, that it's something I should have done years ago.

Bullshit. You know what?

> It's never too late to start something.

Last year I thought, more than usual, about this issue and I've decided to take action.
I've committed myself to write more.

Writing is a wonderful tool to both organize thoughts and foster new perspectives.  
But writing alone is not enough. Publish is also an important aspect.

So, here's my **Hello World** (a blog is not a blog without a hello world post)

> Yes, I'm starting a blog (and you should too).  

I'm not sure which kind of blog is going to be.  
I suspect I'll write mostly about my professional life and things I'm interested in like **design**, **computation**, **data** and **user experience** alongside all the possible intersections in between. Â 

If this happens to be useful for someone, that's great.

The easiest part done! Now, let's keep the commitment up.

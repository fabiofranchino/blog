I've already wrote about the Drag&Drop functionality, in a more detailed way, with Vue.js [here](/blog/build-drag-drop-image-component-vue/).

This time, I want to make a variation using text files instead of images. The real goal was to convert a dropped markdown file and render it on screen.

You can test both components using this live prototype:

<iframe height="400px" width="100%" src="https://vue-drop-txt-and-read.abusedmedia.repl.co" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-forms allow-pointer-lock allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-modals"></iframe>

And, of course, grab the full source code [here](https://github.com/fabiofranchino/vue-drop-txt-and-read).

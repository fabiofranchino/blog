I read with care "[The web began dying in 2014, here's how](https://staltz.com/the-web-began-dying-in-2014-heres-how.html)" article. You should too.

It gives an interesting glimpse of a possible future of the **internet** and the **web**.

It does try to outline how the **web** is going to be less relevant because of big players dominance.

**Internet** will continue to stay here as the technical backbone but the **web** will be less and less relevant.

The problem relies on the actual main players (GOOG, FB, AMZN). They are divvying up the web into different and separated key components: AI, social and e-commerce by means of their walled gardens.

The future envisioned by the author looks much more to a place owned by big companies **without any chances to live independently** with dignity and relevance as it can happen so far.

It's a *dystopian* view of the online society.

To avoid this chance, we all have to do our little share.

I'm particularly excited to announce my upcoming Data Visualization courses, same field but different context.

## Big Dive 7

This year, alongside the regular program to become a data scientist, there will be an additional module, completely devoted to the Dataviz discipline, designed specifically for wannabes dataviz practitioners. 

[Big Dive into Dataviz](https://www.bigdive.eu/becomedatascientist/data-viz-intensive/) is the intensive hands-on educational course that will take place, from **11th to 15th June 2018**, in Turin, Italy.

If you are more a techy-guy, interested in data science field then [Big Dive 7 full program](https://www.bigdive.eu/becomedatascientist/big-dive-7/) is a better option. You're still going to learn the fundamentals of the data visualization alongside other disciplines.

## Adventures in Data Visualization

By following the experimental tone of the last edition, this year the usual summer workshop dedicated to the data visualization will open its doors to the cryptocurrency world. Can't wait to see the final results.

The workshop will take place in Lugano, Switzerland from **15th to 19th July 2018**.

It's almost one year ago the first post of this blog and I cannot be more happy with its current status.
It's hard to be committed to something. It requires dedication.  
It's extremely easy to get distracted and let it go somewhere.
But it's the rewarding part that counts.  
And it's for that reason that I'm going to increase my commitment to it. 

I'll write something more about my motivation behind it. Now, let's enjoy this little break. 

Personal wise, this year has been tough, therefore, I can't wait to meet you, dear 2018.

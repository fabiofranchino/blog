Usually, having competitors is a pain point in a business model canvas. To me, they are opportunities.

I started a [personal project](/blog/lets-talk-about-presenting-information-and-data/) I enjoy working on. It's based on a personal idea and vision, but as everything happens on internet, there's a high chance that similar things already exist.

> [Presenta](https://www.presenta.cc) makes [no exception](/blog/lets-talk-about-presentation-tools/).

Having *competitors* is not negative. I always find interesting learning about how others faced and solved similar problems I had. It's not about copying, it's **learning** and **get inspiration** to come up with something better at solving the same problem.

The notion of *competitors* doesn't really sound right to me. It's not a competition. It's more about trying innovating all together with different solutions.

This is why I consider all the mentioned similar tools a good source of inspiration. If there's a good idea in a product, why make it different at any cost? I'm much more learning from a good solution and try to make it better.

This post is a preface of a series that is meant to describe what I find very good from other products that might potentially be used in Presenta as well.

I strongly believe in the *remix culture*. Everything is a *remix*. Innovation is *remixing*.

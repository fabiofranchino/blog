Following the previous article about getting the whole list of the cryptocurrencies from Coinmarketcap.com, here the same scraping code packed in a nice end-point call thanks to [Runkit](https://runkit.com/), of course.

I've resurrected a previous and working example that uses Cheerio to transform the HTML source in a JSON array.

You can check the source [here](https://runkit.com/abusedmedia/coinmarketcap-all-list-api) or test the API call straight [there](https://coinmarketcap-all-list-api-hki9psot86nl.runkit.sh/).

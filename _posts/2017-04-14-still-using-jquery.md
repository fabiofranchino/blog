## One upon a time

While some time ago I thought I'd never use [jQuery](https://jquery.com) anymore, right now I'm definitely suggesting to consider it for your projects. I do for mine.

## Vanilla

I know that the current browser **DOM Api** adoption can be considered pretty solid and widespread. 
I agree also with the public voices out there that teaches us about preferring [vanilla](http://vanilla-js.com/) javascript over bloating libraries.
I know those libraries like jQuery, among the other things, try to keep legacy browsers into the game while it would be better for all to let them out.
No matter all those true facts are, there are some good reasons to continue to use jQuery for your final web stuff.

## It depends

Let's be clear. It depends on the project type.
If you are building a library then maybe you should try to avoid other libraries as much as possible. Avoiding them means to get rid of dependencies and future uncertainty about its functionality.
It also means you are not forcing your users to include thirty party code, not to mention the risk of conflicts between versions of the same library (the browser is still a huge global scope eventually).

But if you are building some user interface object like a website of something, well, I think you could afford about **29Kb** of code to write less and cleaner code, introducing less potential bugs and issues, don't you?

## jQuery is dead. Long live to jQuery

To be fair, the whole point about avoiding jQuery because its size is totally absurd, to say the least.

Having said that, my all present and next projects will include jQuery because of its benefits.
I suggest doing the same. jQuery is still a live project with a vibrant community behind it. It's not going to fade away anytime soon.

And you? Are you still using jQuery?

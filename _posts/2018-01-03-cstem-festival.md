Over the first decade of this millennium I've been involved in a practice that definitely shaped my creative view as well as my professional life, a practice thoroughly defined by *Philip Galanter* as:

> «[…] an art practice where the artist uses a system, such as a set of natural language rules, a computer program, a machine, or other procedural invention, which is set into motion with some degree of autonomy contributing to or resulting in a completed work of art.»

I'm talking about the Generative Art field.

In 2005, I've had the insane idea to organize a public festival dedicated to that field (I was very passionate about). I've had to learn how to design a public event, inviting people, finding support and fundings, managing logistics and expenses and hundreds of other things that I've never done before.

The festival got three editions over three years in a row, then, things became more complex in my life, thus, it never saw the fourth edition.

Recently, I've restored its edition' websites, therefore, I thought it would have been nice to keep them online for posterity. After a bit of work to remove server-side scripting (in order to use the Github free hosting), [here the starting point](/cstem/) to explore this portion of my life.

PS: They'll remain online as long as Github will allow free hosting :)

## A personal reminder

This is something to keep always in mind on daily basis, with no particular order, to lead a happy group of people that is supposed to do great things:

- Talk
- Listen (carefully)
- Interact with them as a team
- Give feedback individually
- Be honest
- Engage them
- Give them independence and initiative

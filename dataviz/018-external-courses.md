Working with [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) and the Web Platform require a basic understanding of the fundamental technologies of the web, such as HTML, CSS and Javascript.

I'm going to outline the basics of these tech but if you need more time and further exercise to keep confidence with them, I'd suggest the following online courses that might help you:

### FreeCodeCamp

A community of learners and teachers focussed on free lessons about different aspect of the web technologies. I suggest to start with HTML&CSS module. Here's the [link](https://www.freecodecamp.org).

### Codecademy

An online tool to learn the basics on HTML, CSS and Javascript through step by step hands-on incremental lessons.

- HTML basic online course [here](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html-css)
- Javascript basic online course [here](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-javascript)

Go to the next lesson: [Understanding HTML](understanding-html.html)

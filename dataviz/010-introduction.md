It's been around 2012 the year that the pilot of the course saw the light.  
At that time, I needed a name for it and I remember that it came up in my mind quite automatically. I thought that it would be an adventure for me, therefore, adventures in data visualization resonates appropriate to me. Since then, I've adopted that name to refer to all the dataviz and d3.js courses I taught.

Over the years, I've continued to study in order to refine the course, structuring the materials, updating and fixing the examples. At some point, I started to manage this corpus of material in a [repository](https://github.com/abusedmedia/ADV-handout).

This is a kind of a more mature follow-up of that material. I'm trying to give more soul and substance to the course with a collection of articles, following the same premise, to guide the student on a learning path, from zero to something visualized on screen.

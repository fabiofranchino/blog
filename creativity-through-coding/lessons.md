### Lesson 0 (intro, tools&libs)

- Outline course
- Reason why code for designer and prototype
- Sketch mode (explanation, demostration, demo)
- Goal of the course (understanding programming potential in creative context)
- Tools overview (Codepen, Repl.it)
- Technologies we're going to use
  - SVG, HTML, CSS selection
  - TweenMax, jQuery
  - Adobe Illustration / Sketch / Figma
  - Programming paradigms: **variable**, **functions**, **condition**, **loop**
- The SVG coordinate system

### Lesson 1 (animation the basics)

- **HTML** basics
- **SVG** elements (rect, circle, line, g, path, polygon, text, image)
- **CSS** basics and **selection**
- **Comments** on different languages
- Intro to **DevTool** for debugging purposes
- **TweenMax** basics (to,from,x,y,scale,rotation,delay,origin,ease)
- **Exercise**: 
  - Make a face by hands and make transition-in
- **Assignment**: 

### Lesson 2 (interaction the basics)

- What is a **Function**
- jQuery for basic *click* interactions
- **Exercise:** 
  - The face now can goes out upon click 
- What is **Random**
- Explore further events (mouseenter, mouseleave)
- **Exercise:** 
  - The face now can be manipulate with the mouse using the random generator for each element
- What is a **Variable**
- The **THIS** special variable in mouse events
- **Exercise:** 
  - The face now can be manipulate with all the mouse events exploiting the THIS variable

### Lesson 3 (more transitions/interactions)

- The **viewBox** attribute
- The **stagger** feature and the **Set**
- **Exercise:** 
  - Make a grid of elements that enter in with **from**
  - Make the same grid that enter on click
  - Use the THIS mouse event to manipulate elements
- Use a **numeric variable**
- **Exercise:**
  - incrementing a number: make element bigger on clicks
  - increm / decrem same number

### Lesson 4 (Illustrator as asset editor)

- Prepare a file in Adobe Illustrator
- Export options
- Copy/Paste the SVG code
- **Exercise:**
  - make a grid in AI e staggerIn the elements
  - make them interactive
- Loading the SVG with JS
- The find() function to subselect elements
- **Exercise:**
  - make a row of complex elements, staggerIn, make them interactive, use THIS to manipulate with Random

### Lesson 5 (UI)

- UI exploration with the same techniques (modal, offcanvas, tabs, slider)
- **Exercise:**
  - make a modal + offcanvas
- Load and play an **Audio** file, TweenMax fo volume
- **Exercise:**
  - make a modal to allow the user choose 3 audio sample

### **Exercise**: generative logo, btn to change them random, or [loop](https://github.com/golanlevin/lectures/tree/master/lecture_loops) graphic composition



### Lesson 6 (more logic)

- What is a **Condition**
- The boolean value and the offcanvas
- **Exercise:**
  - make two off panel (up and down)
- The **clone** function
- **Exercise:**
  - make a panel to generate from 3 elements
- Text&Fonts



### Lesson 7 (more goodies)

- Draw, Morph and Follow
- **Exercise:**
  - Make a two selector, draw and morph by click
  - Make cloned elements following a path (baloons)

### Lesson 8x

- What is a **State**
- Set a state variable to any element (data() + THIS)
- Masking
- Callback functions
- Dynamic text
- The Date object
- Repeat & Yoyo
- TweenMax Drag
- Mousemove event and coordinate conversion

### Lesson x

- saving and loading data in the cloud
